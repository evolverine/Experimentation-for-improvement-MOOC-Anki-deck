# Experimentation for improvement Anki deck
An [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck for [the "Experimentation for Improvement" MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/experimentation/home/welcome), taught by Kevin Dunn from McMaster University

# Goals

I hope this deck can support others taking the course, or even people who have already finished it, to solidify their knowledge and memorize it for longer.

# How to use
1. Install [Anki Desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Install [the CrowdAnki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) and restart Anki Desktop.
3. From Anki Desktop, `select File -> CrowdAnki: Import from git repository`. Enter *https://github.com/evolverine/Experimentation-for-improvement-MOOC-Anki-deck* in the dialog that appears and click `OK`. The "Experimentation for improvement MOOC" deck should appear, and you can start studying it.

Note that the optimization chart background only appears if the card is tagged with the "experimentation-for-improvement" tag.

# How to keep up to date with changes and additions
Repeat step 3 above, ideally on a daily basis.
The one limitation is that if a note is removed in this deck this won't be reflected in your personal deck. But we will try to keep this in mind and, when necessary, change the content of notes instead of deleting them.

# How to contribute
There are two ways: through git or through opening an issue on github.

## 1. Through `git`
Some basic knowledge of `git` is necessary for this. (If you don't know what `git` is, best to use the second method, below.) 

First, make any change to the deck you see fit. Then, from AnkiDesktop select File -> Export. In the dialog that appears select *CrowdAnki JSON representation (*directory)* in the "Export format" drop-down, and then the "Experimentation for improvement MOOC" deck in the "Include" drop-down. Leave "Include media" and "Include tags" checked. Click on *Export...* and select the directory where you cloned this repository. Then...

## 2. Through github issues
Navigate to [this repository's issue list](https://github.com/evolverine/Experimentation-for-improvement-MOOC-Anki-deck/issues) and click the "New issue" button. In that issue describe as clearly as possible what you would like changed or added to the deck.
